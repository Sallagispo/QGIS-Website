Expenses reporting
------------------

**Date of voting**: 2019-12-03

**Proponent**: Paolo Cavallini

**Rationale**: For each expenditure, after the work / item is done, but before payment, 
a report must be completed by the proponent, according to a simple template:

* Date of resolution
* Date of delivery
* Proponent
* Description of results
* Eventual links to full description, commit etc.
* Evaluation (success, partial success, failure).

Reports can be very short in case they are simple tasks, but we aim at completeness  
For recurring costs, only the initial report should be done  
All reports will be added to a single location.

Meetings
--------

**Date of voting**: 2019-12-03

**Proponent**: Paolo Cavallini

**Rationale**: To make our meetings more productive, the proposal is:

* Regular meeting once a month, at a fixed date ad hoc short meetings are encouraged, 
  and can be called anytime to discuss single issues and to have faster decisions and avoid too long regular meetings; 
  only a subset of the PSC members can be present at the ad hoc meetings, if they are not interested in that specific topic; 
  their vote will be counted as +0. A PSC member can block an ad hoc meeting if he feels strongly about participating 
  but has not a time slot available. In this case it will be postponed to the monthly standard meeting.
* Every meeting will appoint a Chair, normally the PSC Chair, and a Secretary (not necessarily always the same person), 
  who will have the responsibility for completing the minutes; cooperative editing should be allowed.

**Votes**: In favour: Anita, Tim, Paolo, Andreas, Jürgen, Marco

**Decision**: Approved

**Notes**: none

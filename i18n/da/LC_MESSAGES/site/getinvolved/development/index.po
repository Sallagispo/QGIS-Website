#~ "If you have a crash it might be useful to include a backtrace as the bug "

#~ "state of the process when the crash happened. Depending on you distribution "
#~ "the automatic creation of core dumps might be disabled. In that case you "

#~ " unlimited`` before starting QGIS. You could also include that in your "
#~ "``.profile``. Start qgis from the shell and repeat the steps to reproduce "
#~ "the crash. After the crash the core file will be located in the current "
#~ "directory. To produce a backtrace from it you start ``gdb "
#~ "/path/to/the/qgis/binary core``. The binary is usually ``/usr/bin/qgis`` or "
#~ "``/usr/bin/qgis.bin`` on Debian with the GRASS plugin installed. In ``gdb`` "
